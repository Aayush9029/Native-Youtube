## FAQ:

> **Where's the non menu bar version that worked on BigSur?**

It's in the [Mubbii branch](https://github.com/Aayush9029/Native-Youtube/tree/Mubbii)
It is no longer being maintained however there are forks of the "Mubbii" which are being maintained.
*Note: The codebase for Mubbii is very bad as it was hacked together in couple hours*

> **Why drop support for Mubbii?**

Mubbii required mpv and youtube-dl to be installed. This is a standalone app. Internals have been reworked from the ground up for new macOS version.

> **How do I Get a YouTube API Key?**
